# Experience

## SC SOFT ATAC SRL - SoferOnline
- [Web](https://soferonline.ro/) and mobile ([Android](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=soferonline+play+store&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/soferonline-chestionare-auto/id1032823451))

SoferOnline.ro - Web & mobile app for e-learning (diving school students, road legislation, driving theory and questionnaires for future drivers) and ERP for driving schools.

- _09.2022_ - On Going - Junior FrontEnd Developer

-I've started working on this project in the marketing division, creating designs for marketing and the web/mobile apps.
Later I transitioned into web development, as I gained an interest for transforming the designs I created into real components and pages for the website. I've worked closely with the development team and my brother who built this platform from scratch and learned a lot from them.

**I've helped with:**
- **integrating CarVertical** forms & banners into SoferOnline for our users to benefit from a discount
- **redesigning & rewriting the sales page** dedicated to driving schools (where they can see the features we offer, pricing and contact details)
- updating the card payment flow (integrated with Netopia MobilPay) to adhere to invocing legal requirements in Romania
- creating landing pages for new marketing campaigns (& adding promo codes in the backend)
- **releasing/deploying** new versions to production
- syncying with the rest of the team for updates
- gathering user feedback, discussing it with the team and proposing app changes
- various bug fixes and improvements

The app is built using NextJS & React (TypeScript), consuming a Symfony PHP API, integrating with various services for payments, analytics, email, notifications, etc. The mobile app is built using React Native. CI/CD is automated using GitHub Actions, adheres to a simplified GitFlow system (as it's a small team); for task management we use GitHub projects.

- _09.2018_ - On Going - Marketing Specialist

When I've joined the team, marketing for this product was not really a strong point (as my brother had mostly focused on development), so I've started creating an online presence for our product, with all that was needed for it to shine and grow: marketing strategy, Social Media content, blog articles, presence and engagement; marketing campaigns, ads, search optimisation and automations (chat).

**I've helped with:**
- Managed social media presence and created relevant and engaging content. Built, tested, optimized and executed ads. Improved the product's visibility via SEO and ASO.
- Increased the leads and conversion rate (to paid subscriptions) by over 60%.
- Market research & analysis (audience, campaigns, industry trends, competitors etc.)
- Managed and supervised communication with clients and strategic partners, improved the communication process via ChatBot automation.
- Writing blog articles & maintining the Wordpress blog.
- Worked directly with the IT team: aggregating customer feedback, helped at designing the web app, sales campaigns, mobile app and user flows;

- _07.2021 - 09.2022_ - Tester

- Manually tested the website / mobile app and documented bugs;
- Helped at decreasing the bug occurrences by over 50% in the last year (as reported by Sentry.io)
- Additions/ideas that helped improve the user experience throughout the app (based on user reviews & my own testing).

## Personal Projects

**Èšine Minte** (_11.2022_ - On Going): https://tine-minte.softatac.com/ 

The app offers a place to organize notes/tasks by projects; be them work related (documents expiration dates, events, etc.) or personal events (a birthday, a trip etc.) and get notifications before the date. **You can CRUD your notes and set a due date for them.**

This is one of my first "real" projects, intended to help me learn the basics of web development. I wanted to actually build something usefull and get it into production, in the hands of users.

Work in progress and next steps for the app:
- To implement email notifications based on the project's due date.
- Add extra security measures.

The Front-End part of the app was my main task. It's built with NextJS (React and TypeScript), with TailwindCSS, CSS modules. The backend was built using Symfony PHP. It's deployed on Hosterion webservers, the NextJS project being build and exported as static files.

**Music Quiz** (_08.2022_): https://quiz-gamma-azure.vercel.app/

Interesting quizzes about music. It is an application that I use frequently together with my friends, to have fun and test our knowledge in the field of music. 
A project with the purpose to practice React.js
